[Interactive Web Development Quiz](https://github.com/Polibeerex/Interactive-Quiz)

## Project Overview

This project is a quiz application built with JavaScript. It demonstrates a wide range of JavaScript skills and concepts, including:

### Array Manipulation

The project uses an array of objects to store the quiz questions, each with a set of answers and the index of the correct answer. This demonstrates the ability to work with complex data structures and manipulate arrays.

### DOM Manipulation

The project extensively uses Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation to dynamically update the content of the webpage. This includes displaying the current question, updating the score, and showing the final result. This showcases the ability to interact with the DOM using JavaScript.

### Event Handling

The project uses event listeners to handle user interactions, such as selecting an answer and moving to the next question. This demonstrates the ability to handle events and create interactive web applications.

### Conditional Logic

The project uses conditional logic to check if the selected answer is correct, to move to the next question, and to show the result when all questions have been answered. This showcases the ability to use conditional logic to control the flow of the application.

### Function Creation

The project involves creating several functions, including `displayQuestion()` for displaying the current question and options, and `updateProgressBar()` for updating the progress bar. This demonstrates the ability to create and use functions in JavaScript.

### Audio Control

The project includes a mute button that controls the background music. This showcases the ability to control audio using JavaScript.

### Progress Bar

The project includes a progress bar that updates as the user progresses through the questions. This demonstrates the ability to create dynamic UI elements.

### Dark Theme

The project supports a dark theme, providing an alternative color scheme for the quiz application. This enhances the user experience by allowing users to choose their preferred visual style.
